#### About the Dataset

This dataset compiles provenance records from the Art Institute of Chicago’s online collection database.  
It includes artworks such as paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, and decorative arts.

In the original API, provenance information appears as *free text*. For the purposes of this workshop, this material has been transformed into **structured provenance events**, where each event includes one or more involved parties (people, families, institutions) and other semantic components. The information of all provenance statements remains exactly as provided by the Art Institute of Chicago — no corrections, additions, or interpretative changes have been introduced.
